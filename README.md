# Developer-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This application is an elegant solution for searching for a recipe based on the userâ€™s local temperature. Users can search for main ingredients and the application will return a list of recipes appropriate for the current temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing, the app will return more soups, baked goods, casseroles, and comfort foods. If it is very warm outside, more grillable foods, cold salads and blended beverages will appear.

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold,  an internet connection and a Github username they should be able to generate a pdf of their resume. 

## Usage
The usage is to be able to generate a pdf resume from the users Github information. 

## Credit
I  created this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I was also provided the css in the generatedHTML.js. 

## Contributing 
I put this homework together with the help from my professor and TAs. I also had additional help from my tutor Isabel Arcopnes. My classmates Mark McGraw, Elliot Trejo and I worked together to pull the data from Githubs documentation. 

## Challenges
This was my first time working with Node.js. Once I figured out a few of the basic commands in my Git terminal it started to flow quicker. I didn't like the repeditive nature of node.js always having to type "node index.js". I found it challenging to find documentation to be able to ask a multiple choice question using node.js. Everytime I googled it I would get search results with practice exams/quizzes with node.js questions.
